* Reduce load on Tomcat, ES and C* caused by permissons calculation.
          
Do we need a distributed cache?
* YES: Todd says we tried non-distributed cache (w/EhCache) and the caching was not effective (bad hit/mss ratio).

Implementation ideas:
* Use Cassandra column family implementation 
* Use Hazelcast cache
* Use EhCache configured for distributed operation

How much should we expect performance to improve? How can we test this?
* JUnit + metrics collection in our cache implementation

Simplest approach seems to be Cassandra. Here's a design:

h1. Add new Core Persistence Cache module

This is a new module that depends only on the Core Persistence Common module (and maybe Model?) and provides a generic cache interface that is ""segmented"" by a cache scope. When you put or get things you specify the cache scope, and it is possible to invalidate all things within a cache scope with one call.

{code}
public interface SegmentedCache<K,V> {

   /** Put value into segment with ttl */
   void put( CacheScope scope, K key, V value, long ttl );

   /** Get value from segment */
   V get( CacheScope segment, K key );

   /** Delete all cache data of all types and of all scopes */
   void invalidate();

   /** Delete all cache data within specified segment */
   void invalidate( CacheScope segment );
}
{code}

Caches are stored in Cassandra *Usergrid_Cache* column family:
* Row-key is applicationId
* Column key is toString() of K key
* Value is serialized V value object

h1. Plugin our Cache into Shiro at the REST module level

To plugin to Shiro, we provide implementations of the Shiro *CacheManager* and *Cache* interfaces that are backed by the Cache module. 

When permissions are updated, we need need to ensure that the old cached permissions are invalidated. So we will modify the *EntityManager* revoke and grant methods to call invalidate for the application's cache scope.

Review the algorithm, and determine the cause of the additional shard proposals.

Usergrid currently performs 5 shard lookups on write and most miss the cache.  We'll change the following

*Shard allocation*

Shard allocation will not perform a propose + check phase. The following algorithm will occur.  This must occur at EACH_QUORUM to ensure that we have consensus across regions.  

Any node will propose a new shard pivot.  This pivot will have compacted set to false, and will have a column timestamp of a new timeuuid in micros

The proposing node will then read back all compacted = false shard pivots.  The shard pivot with the minimum timestamp will be retained, all others will be deleted as proposals.  This will function similarly to distributed read locks in Cassandra.  Lowest proposed value always wins. 

Allocation is complete

*Shard compaction*

After a successful proposal allocation, the allocating node will copy all edges from the previously compacted shard into the new shard.  It will continue to copy until no new edges are returned on read.

Once read has been completed, all edges that were copied can be deleted from the previous shard.  

This target shard will be marked as compacted

*Consistency*

When performing consistency, we will need a higher consistency level.  To ensure that shards exist worldwide, proposal + selection should occur at EACH_QUORUM.  Standard reads can occur as LOCAL_QUORUM

Here are some questions to consider and a proposal.

h3. Should application be saved as multiple files?

One advantage of saving to multiple files is that we can use multiple threads to write the files and that will make the export faster.  For example, we could start a thread to write out each collection of an app as it's own file, or set of files.

h3. Should each collection be saved as multiple files?

Each collection must be written out serially if we want to preserve order. If that is the case, then saving each collection to multiple files won't help much there.

h3. Should connections be separated out from entities in collections?

Currently, we write an entities connections right into the entity itself inside. This will be a problem if we have entities with a huge number of connections, it will cause entity size to bloat and could cause an import program to fail.  Connections should be stored in a separate file.

h3. Should result be one large file for the sake of convenience?

We could concatenate the multiple files together, or use tar and gzip them at the end of the process.

h3. Multiple files proposal

1. Each collection will be written out to a set of files named like this:

   {{<orgname>_<appname>_<collname>_collection_N.json}}


2. For each collection, outgoing connections will be written to a set of files named like this:

   {{<orgname>_<appname>_<collname>_connections.N.json}}


Each connection will be a JSON object with fields: 

   {{source, sourceType, target, targetType, targetType}}


3. A command-line parameter specifies max size of each output file.

4. Implementation should use a thread for each collection of an application. Currently, we have only one write thread which limits our throughput.

We should change our mapping to use a static structure, and resolve this operational pain.

We need to make the following changes.

h2. Modify our IndexScope

This should more closely resemble the elements of an edge since this represents an edge. It will simplify the use of our query module and make development clearer.  This scope should be refactored into the following objects.  

* IndexEdge - Id, name, timestamp, edgeType (source or target)
* SearchEdge - Id, name, edgeType

Note: edgeType is the type of the Id within the edge.  Does this Id represent a source Id, or does it represent a targetId?  The entity to be indexed will implicitly be the opposite of the type specified.  I.E if it's a source edge, the document is the target.  If it's a target edge, the document is the source.

These values should also be stored within our document, so that we can index our documents.  Note that we perform bidirectional indexing in some cases, such was users, groups etc.  When we do this, we need to ensure that mark the direction of the edge appropriately.

h2. Change default sort ordering

When sorting is unspecified, we should order by timestamp descending from our index edge.  This ensures that we retain the correct edge time semantics, and will properly order collections and connections

h2. Remove the legacy query class

We don't need the Query class, it has far too many functions to be a well encapsulated object.  Instead, we should simply take the string QL, the SearchEdge and the limit to return our candidates.  From there, we should parse and visit the query internally to the query logic, NOT externally.

h2. Create a static mapping

The mapping should contains the following static fields.

* entityId - The entity id
* entityType - The entity type (from the id)
* entityVersion - The entity version
* edgeId - The edge Id
* edgeName - The edge name
* edgeTimestamp - The edge timestamp
* edgeType - source | target
* edgeSearch - edgeId + edgeName + edgeType


It will then contain an array of ""fields""  Each of these fields will have the following formation.

{code}
{ ""name"":""[entity field name as a path]"", ""[field type]"":[field value}
{code}



We will define a field type for each type of field.  Note that each field tuple will always contain a single field and a single value.  Possible field types are the following.

* string - This will be mapped into 2 mapping with multi mappings.  It will be a string unanalyzed, and an analyzed string.  The 2 fields will then be ""string_u"" and ""string_a"".  The Query visitor will need to update the field name appropriately
* long - An unanalyzed long
* double - An unanalyzed double
* boolean - An unanalyzed boolean
* location - A geolocation field
* uuid - A UUID stored as an unanalyzed string

The entity path will be a flattened path from the root json element to the max json element.  It can be though of as a path through the tree of json elements.  We will use a dot '.' to delimit the fields.  X.Y.Z for nested objects.  Primitive arrays will contain a field object for each element in the array.

h2. Indexing

  When indexing entities, we will no longer modify or prefix field names.  They will be inserted into the value exactly as their path appears after lower case.

h2. Querying

  When querying, the ""contains"" operation for a string will need to use the ""string_a"" data type.  When using =, we will need to use the string_u data type.  Each criteria will need to use nested object querying, to ensure the property name and property value are both part of the same field tuple.
